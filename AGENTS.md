# Yeko Project Intelligence Bridge

This project uses a dual-IDE setup (Kiro & Windsurf). The absolute "Source of Truth" for architectural patterns, security protocols, and engineering standards is located in the `./kiro/` directory.

## Core Protocols

When acting as Cascade, you MUST strictly adhere to the instructions found in:

- **Architecture & Ethics:** refer to `./kiro/steering/project_constitution.md`
- **Development Standards:** refer to `./kiro/steering/dev_coder_steering.md`
- **Security Protocols:** refer to `./kiro/steering/security_auditor_steering.md`

## Multi-Agent Behavior

Cascade should emulate the specialized roles defined in `.kiro/subagents/`. If a task requires deep architectural planning, adopt the persona in `./kiro/steering/architect_steering.md`.

## Language Policy

- **French-First:** All UI strings must be localized using the i18n patterns defined in project specs. Hardcoding is prohibited.
